# BehaviourToolkit
This plugin provides a set of tools to create custom and complex behaviour in the Godot 4.x Game Engine.

### Features & Design Goals

- Fusion and extension of different behaviour paradigms

### Using templates
When cloning this repository/importing the plugin, make sure to not only add the `addons` directory to your project, but also the `script_templates` directory. This allows you to have preconfigured script templates when extending behaviour nodes, providing you with virtual methods and a logical naming scheme.
